## Methodology
Our project consists of the following core modules:
1. **Subtitle Generation**
    - Create a subtitle file for the input video using Whisper model
2. **Keyframe Extraction**
    - Frame Sampling: Samples frames at a set frequency from videos.
    - Feature Extraction: Utilizes deep learning models like GoogLeNet v1 to extract features from frames.
    - Highlightness Score Calculation: Deep Summarization Network (DSN) computes scores to identify keyframes.
    - Dialogue Grouping: Groups frames based on dialogues to select significant keyframes.
3. **Panel Layout Generation**
    - Calculates the Region of Interest of a frame 
    - Selects a page layout template
    - Crops frame to be accomodated into template
4. **Balloon Generation & Placement**
    - Analysis of emotions in subtitles determines speech balloon shape.
    - Balloon placement involves using the "Dlib" face-detector library to detect characters' mouth positions in frames and placing at regions with relatively lesser ROI.
5. **Cartoonization**
    - Applies style transfer algorithms to enhance keyframes visually, mimicking traditional comics.

## Pre-requisites
- Python
- All dependencies mentioned in `requirements.txt` to be installed. (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Running the program
- Store your video in the `video` folder and add the path to video in  `main.py`
- Run `main.py`
- The output can be found by opening the `page.html` file in the `output` folder
- You will have to clear the contents of the frames folder and the final folder (inside frames folder) before running the program again
